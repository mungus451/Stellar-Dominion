                <p class="text-lg mb-4">The universe of Stellar Dominion is persistent and ever-evolving. Time progresses in automated <strong>10-minute turns</strong>, ensuring your empire grows and gathers resources even when you are offline. Each turn, every commander in the galaxy is granted a baseline of resources to fuel their ambition: <strong>2 Attack Turns</strong>, <strong>1 Untrained Citizen</strong>, and a foundational income of <strong>Credits</strong>. This steady pulse ensures a dynamic and constantly shifting strategic landscape.</p>

                <h2 class="font-title text-3xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">The Engine of an Empire: Economy & Income</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">A thriving economy is the bedrock of galactic conquest. Your income is not static; it is a direct reflection of your strategic decisions. The formula is simple, yet offers deep strategic choice: `Income = floor((5000 + (Workers * 50)) * (1 + (Wealth Points * 0.01)))`.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Base Income:</strong> Every commander receives a standard stipend of 5,000 credits per turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Worker Income:</strong> Each 'Worker' unit adds 50 credits to your income per turn, making them a crucial economic backbone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wealth Proficiency:</strong> By investing points into your 'Wealth' stat, you gain a cumulative 1% bonus to your total income for every point allocated.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Your population begins as 'Untrained Citizens,' a raw resource waiting to be molded. On the `battle.php` page, you can transform these citizens into a variety of specialized units, each with a specific role and credit cost. A high 'Charisma' stat reduces the cost of all units, rewarding diplomatic proficiency with economic efficiency.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Guards:</strong> Your first line of defense, essential for protecting your resources from enemy commanders.</p>

                <h2 class="font-title text-3xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">The Crucible of Power: Combat & Plunder</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">Conflict is inevitable. From the `attack.php` page, you can launch assaults against other commanders, spending your Attack Turns to project your power across the stars. Combat is a calculation of might and strategy:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Offense vs. Defense:</strong> Your 'Offense Power,' derived from your Soldiers and enhanced by your 'Strength' proficiency, is pitted against your opponent's 'Defense Rating,' which is calculated from their Guards and 'Constitution' proficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Victory & Spoils:</strong> A successful attack results in plunder. You will steal a percentage of the defender's on-hand credits, with the amount scaling based on the number of Attack Turns you committed to the assault.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experience & Growth:</strong> Every battle, win or lose, grants experience points (XP) to both commanders based on the damage they dealt. Conflict, even in defeat, is a catalyst for growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="font-title text-3xl text-cyan-400 mb-4">Ascension: The Leveling System</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">As you gain experience from combat, you will level up. Each new level grants you a <strong>Proficiency Point</strong>, a powerful currency that allows for permanent, strategic specialization of your empire. These points can be spent on the `levels.php` page to enhance your core stats, each providing a +1% bonus per point up to a maximum of 75.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg">
                    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Directly increases the Offense Power of your fleet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> Bolsters the Defense Rating of your empire, making you a harder target.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Increases your credit income each turn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Charisma:</strong> Reduces the credit cost for training all units.</li>
